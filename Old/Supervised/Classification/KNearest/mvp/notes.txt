Phase 1
* Create a file called clean.py that cleans the data as follows:
    clean up Name
    get rid of heading row
    get rid of rows with empty value for BA, OBP, SLG
    get rid of all columns except PA, HR, RBI, BA, OBP, SLG
    remove MVP column
    save MVP column to a new file called mvp_y.csv
    save Name column to a new file called names.csv
    save rest in file called mvp_X.csv

Phase 2
* create an examine_data.py
* create a train_test_predict.py file that uses KNearest to predict

How did the algorithm do?
Experiment with different values of K and see what happens to youyr score
